Simple quiz application developed in ReactNative - G2i Code Challenge

# Description
This is a simple app project I've developed to the G2i Code Challenge. G2i is a company who hire talented React and ReactNative engineers to join their client projects.

# Toolset
- react-native init =]
- "react-navigation" to ease navigation between screens.
- "axios" (I like it more then JS native fetch).

# Concepts used
- No boilerplate bullshit (no Ignite or ReactNative boilerplate).
- State management and sharing between screens.
- Separation between UI and business logic.
- Simple navigation.
- Componentization.
- Good UI/UX concepts.
- REST API communication.
